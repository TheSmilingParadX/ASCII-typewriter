# TYPO-MATIC | MODEL IX
An artwork for the New Wave section of the YLEM 45th gathering.

A browser-based emulation of a typewriter that doubles as an ASCII art tool. Every keystroke is permanent, and the only way to fix a mistake is to rip the page out and throw it in the trash. It is a simple idea: type carefully, or start over.
